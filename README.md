## IMAGE COMPRESSION USING GRAPH COLORING

### Using Mathlab and C++

Image compression is used in daily life basis and to avoid complexity of large image we compressed image uisng graph coloring.

  ## conclusion
In the project image compression techniques using graph coloring are implemented. Most image
compression techniques achieve high data compression ratio. The tradeoff between data
compression remains one of the difficult problems .Maintaining high compression ratio with
good image quality is possible at a more less high computational cost. One of the main goals for
image data compression is to reduce the redundancy in image block as much as possible. That is ,
it is very important to represent as an image with as few bits as possible while maintaining good
image quality.
